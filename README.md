# CoherenceGame
My goal is to create a fun a heart coherence game using Heartmath’s emWave Pro software. Heart coherence is a physiological indicator of emotional wellbeing. By going into heart coherence, you can reduce stress and anxiety (read more about it on Heartmath’s Website). You can get into heart coherence using what they call a Quick Coherence technique, which involves heart focused breathing pattern and generating a rejuvenating emotion such as peace or gratitude.
